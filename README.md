# IPL_WINNING_TEAM_PREDICTION_USING_PYTHON_AND_ML




## Overview
This project aims to predict the winning team of an IPL match using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical IPL data and utilizes various features such as team strength, player statistics, venue, and match conditions to make predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw IPL data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting key features that influence match outcomes, such as team composition, venue, and recent performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction Interface**: A simple interface to input match details and get the predicted winning team.
