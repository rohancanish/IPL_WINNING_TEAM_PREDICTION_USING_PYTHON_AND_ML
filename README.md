# IPL_WINNING_TEAM_PREDICTION_USING_PYTHON_AND_ML




## Overview
This project aims to predict the winning team of an IPL match using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical IPL data and utilizes various features such as team strength, player statistics, venue, and match conditions to make predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw IPL data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting key features that influence match outcomes, such as team composition, venue, and recent performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction Interface**: A simple interface to input match details and get the predicted winning team.

 ## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes historical IPL match data, such as:

Match results
Team and player statistics
Venue details
Toss decisions
Model Training
The project implements several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification problems.
Decision Trees: A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values.
Random Forests: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
The model with the best performance is selected based on cross-validation results and evaluation metrics.

## Usage
To predict the winning team of an upcoming IPL match:

Load the trained model from the provided notebook.
Input the match details, such as teams, venue, and other relevant factors.
Run the prediction function to get the predicted winner.

## Results
The project achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting match outcomes. Further tuning and feature engineering can improve this performance.
